/// <summary>
/// Burst-compiled job that bilinearly interpolates each finger joint's target rotation from the baked 2D pose
/// grid, slerps the current rotation toward it, and writes the result to transforms via TransformAccessArray.
/// Uses JointMapping to recover (fingerIdx, jointIdx) from the compact TAA layout.
///
/// The interpolation used to be a separate 10-item job feeding a 30-entry target array. Folding it in costs no
/// extra slerps -- that job produced 3 joints per finger and this one already runs per joint, so the same 3
/// grid slerps happen either way -- and it removes a job dispatch, a dependency fence and the array round-trip
/// from a chain whose total work is ~3 us but whose completion cost an order of magnitude more than that.
