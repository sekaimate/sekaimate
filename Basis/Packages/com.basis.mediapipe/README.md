# Basis MediaPipe Tracking

Webcam-driven avatar tracking for desktop Basis. It turns a normal webcam into "fake VR"
input: head/neck/upper-body **trackers**, **finger** curl/splay, **eye** gaze + blink, and
**face** blendshapes/visemes — so a desktop user can emote and move like a tracked VR user.

Native inference uses the [MediaPipe Unity Plugin (homuler)](https://github.com/homuler/MediaPipeUnityPlugin)
(Apache-2.0). WebGL inference uses Google's `@mediapipe/tasks-vision` package in a browser
Worker and keeps its models and Wasm runtime in the generated web distribution.

## Status

| Milestone | Scope | State |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **M0** | Package, asmdefs, webcam capture, device-source lifecycle, backend seam | **done** |
| **M1** | FaceLandmarker → eye gaze/blink + 52 ARKit face blendshapes (via Basis.Comms) | **done** |
| **M2** | HandLandmarker → finger curl/splay (via BasisLocalHandDriver) | **done** |
| **M4 (partial)** | Settings tab: enable + camera select + feature toggles | **done** |
| M3 | Head/neck pose + upper-body trackers + calibration + desktop head hand-off | planned |
| M4 | en.json localization, debug overlay, per-platform packaging, perf | planned |

The homuler backend runs FaceLandmarker + HandLandmarker in **VIDEO mode** (synchronous, on the
main thread); M4 will move inference off-thread (LIVE_STREAM + TextureFrame).

## How it fits Basis

- `BasisMediaPipeManagement : BasisBaseTypeManagement` is a **device source**. Add it to the
  `BasisDeviceManagement` GameObject and include it in that object's **`BaseTypes`** list.
  Its per-frame work runs from `BasisDeviceManagement.Simulate()` — the central tick — so it
  adds no new `Update()` loop.
- Body poses are published as `BasisInputXRSimulate` trackers (the framework's existing fake
  device), assigned fixed roles (`Head`, `LeftHand`, `Hips`, …) via `InitalizeTracking(..., ForceAssignTrackedRole: true, role)`.
  Everything downstream (FBIK, the muscle/finger bitstream, bone networking) is reused as-is.
- Fingers will drive `BasisLocalHandDriver.LeftHand/RightHand`; eyes + face blendshapes will go
  through `HVR.Basis.Comms` `AcquisitionService` (already networked to remotes).

## Setup (already wired in this project)

These steps are **done** in this repo — listed so it's reproducible:

1. **Plugin** `com.github.homuler.mediapipe` **0.16.3** is installed via `Packages/manifest.json`
   (`"file:com.github.homuler.mediapipe-0.16.3.tgz"`, tarball alongside the other `*.tgz` deps).
   Unity auto-defines `BASIS_MEDIAPIPE` (via `versionDefines` on `BasisMediaPipe.Homuler.asmdef`),
   activating the homuler backend assembly. If it ever doesn't, add `BASIS_MEDIAPIPE` to
   **Project Settings → Player → Scripting Define Symbols**.
2. **Models** ship as Addressable `TextAsset`s (`.bytes`) in `Packages/com.basis.mediapipe/Models/`:
   `face_landmarker.task.bytes`, `hand_landmarker.task.bytes`, `pose_landmarker_lite.task.bytes`,
   organized into the dedicated **Basis MediaPipe Models** group (PackSeparately) by
   *Basis ▸ Addressables ▸ Organize Model Groups* and an importer on that folder. The loader reads
   them via `Addressables.LoadAssetAsync<TextAsset>(...).WaitForCompletion()` and hands the raw bytes
   to MediaPipe's `modelAssetBuffer`. See
   `com.basis.framework.editor/Editor/ADDRESSABLES.md` for the full group layout and tooling.
3. **Manager**: `BasisMediaPipeManagement` lives on the `BasisDeviceManagement` object and is in
   its `BaseTypes` list. The Settings tab also self-wires it if missing.
4. **For face/eyes to drive your avatar** the avatar needs HVR Basis Comms `AutomaticFaceTracking`
   plus ARKit- or Unified-Expressions-named blendshapes and eye bones (same requirement as
   VRCFaceTracking-over-OSC). **Fingers don't need this** — they drive `BasisLocalHandDriver` directly.

## Using it

Open **Settings → Webcam Tracking**:
- **Enable Webcam Tracking** — turn it on/off.
- **Camera** — pick which webcam to use (live device list).
- **Face & Eyes**, **Hands & Fingers**, **Mirror Camera** — per-feature toggles.

Tuning knobs if something looks reversed (no avatar rebuild needed):
- Blink inverted → flip `MediaPipeFaceConverter.EyeLidIsOpenness`.
- Hands swapped → `HomulerMediaPipeBackend.SwapHands`.
- Finger splay direction/strength → `MediaPipeHandConverter.SplayGain` / `MaxSplayDegrees`.

> Inference runs on the main thread (VIDEO mode), so expect a frame-time cost while enabled until
> the M4 off-thread pass. Cap the camera FPS via `BasisMediaPipeConfig.TargetFps` if needed.

## Platform notes

- **Windows / Linux / macOS desktop:** primary targets; `WebCamTexture` is the capture path.
- **Android phone:** works with the selfie camera (one more native-lib target to package).
- **Quest / standalone HMD:** **not practical** — there is no user-facing camera and passthrough
  cameras are locked down for apps. Use an external/USB camera or a phone as the source instead.

## Notes

- `.meta` files are generated by Unity on first import.
- Monocular webcam tracking estimates depth rather than measuring it: rotation and expression are
  strong, absolute position is approximate (M3 calibration mitigates this). Legs/lower body are
  intentionally out of scope for a seated webcam.
