    /// eye, sitting on that lever arm, is carried FORWARD as the gaze tips down. Look at your own feet and your
    /// eyes travel a good 10 cm out over them; that is not the spine leaning, it is just the neck.
    ///
    /// VR gets this for free, because the HMD is a physical object riding the same lever arm. The spine bend
    /// even has to SUPPRESS the resulting hunch when a chest tracker is present, precisely because a pure
    /// look-down swings the HMD forward and the bend would otherwise misread it as a torso lean (see
    /// BasisSpineLookDownHunchTests). Desktop had no such thing: the eye was pinned over the hips, so the gaze
    /// tipped, the cervical solve hunched the chest, and the head stayed exactly where it was — leaving the neck
    /// to absorb a translation the head should have made itself.
    ///
    /// HORIZONTAL ONLY, deliberately. Eye HEIGHT is left strictly alone: UnscaledDeviceCoord.y is what
    /// CapturePlayerHeight reads, and a pitch-varying eye height would feed straight into the avatar-rescale
    /// loop (the one that ends in 12 m players). The forward carry is the part that was missing and the part
    /// that is safe.
