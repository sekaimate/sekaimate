    /// (the port of BasisFullIKConstraintJob.ApplyCervicalLordosis). It computes the forward neck/upper-
    /// chest curl from head-gaze pitch, the head-pitch clamp, and the extreme-region whole-body
    /// counterbalance. They guard the failure mode the neck has:
    ///
    ///   CHICKEN NECK -- the head poking forward/down with the neck craned, instead of sitting with a
    ///                   gentle resting lordosis that flexes naturally with gaze.
    ///
    /// The headline guards are: the RESTING forward curl at level gaze stays small (a regression that
    /// cranks the base bend is exactly the chicken-neck artifact), the curl is correctly SIGNED (looking
    /// down flexes forward, looking up extends back -- never the reverse), grows MONOTONICALLY with gaze,
    /// is CLAMPED so the gaze can't crane past the anatomical limit, and has NO RATE KINK at level gaze
    /// (the most common pose, where a hard abs() would snap the neck ~4x). The bounds are intentionally
    /// looser than the values the current solver produces (each test notes the measured headroom) so they
    /// fail only on a real regression, not on float noise -- and they bound the curl from ABOVE, so the
    /// neck can be *tuned down* (less chicken neck) without tripping them.
    ///
    /// This is the same math the offline BasisHeadSweep CSV harness scans, asserted here so the "gentle
