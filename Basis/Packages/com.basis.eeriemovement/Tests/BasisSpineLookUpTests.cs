    /// `neck + q*(head-neck)`, an exact rigid orbit. A real look-UP is not that. Cervical extension is
    /// short and a look-up is taken largely by the thoracic spine arching, so the skull barely slides back
    /// over the shoulders -- which is precisely why <see cref="BasisHeadPitchSwingCore"/> scales the
    /// geometric prediction of that travel down to 0.35 on this side of the sweep and nowhere else.

    /// So the un-orbit over-rotates, and the residual (1 - carry) * (R - I) * lever points FORWARD and UP.

    /// counterbalance slides the pelvis back to answer the phantom fold, and the virtual spine strings the

        // is the only YAW-invariant point -- every derived bone orbits it when the view turns. But the eye is
        // not PITCH-invariant, and the leash only ever needed the first property: a head pitches about the base
        // of the skull, so the HMD rides that lever and a look-up carries it ~17 cm BACKWARD with the player's
        // feet welded to the floor. The follow law is deliberately fast (rate 2 + 250*dist/radius adopts about
        // two thirds of that in a single frame at 90 Hz), so the pelvis walked out from under the player, the
        // trunk was left leaning forward to reach a head that had not moved, and once hips->head passed the
        // chain's reach the CCD projected the head onto its reach sphere and it came off the HMD.
        //
