    // ================================================================================================
    // POSTURAL COUNTERBALANCE -- the pelvis translates POSTERIORLY as the trunk folds forward.
    //
    // This is the third leg of a human forward-bend, and the one the solver was missing:
    //   1. pelvis anterior TILT (lumbopelvic rhythm)          -- BasisHipHingeCore
    //   2. pelvis posterior TRANSLATION (this file)           -- the counterweight
    //   3. spinal flexion spread over the segments            -- DistributeSpineBend + the ROM guard
    // With (2) absent the whole fold happens around a pinned pelvis, so the torso drives forward and down
    // into itself: the "chest rotates into the body when I look down" report. It is not a stylistic nicety
    // -- a standing human whose trunk pitches forward without the pelvis coming back has put their centre of
    // mass outside their base of support, which is to say they have started falling over.
    //
    // WHY IT REDUCES TO ONE MULTIPLY. Keep the whole-body COM over the mid-foot. Above-hip mass (head+neck
    // 8.1%, thorax 21.6%, abdomen 13.9%, arms 10.0%; Winter, Biomechanics and Motor Control of Human
    // Movement) is m_up ~ 0.54, its COM sits d ~ 0.55*L above the hip joint for a hips->neck chain of L.
    // The legs pivot about the ankle, so their COM travels ~x/2 when the pelvis travels x:
    //
    //     m_up*(d*sin0 - x) + m_low*(-x/2) = 0   =>   x = m_up*d*sin0 / (m_up + m_low/2) ~ 0.70*d*sin0
    //                                            =>   x ~ 0.38 * L * sin0
    //
    // and L*sin0 is EXACTLY the horizontal projection of the trunk. So the whole model is: the pelvis moves
    // back by a fixed fraction of how far the neck has travelled forward. No trig, no bone axes, no bind to
    // cancel. For L = 0.5 m that is 13 cm at 45 deg and 19 cm at 90 deg, against a measured 15-25 cm for a
    // real full forward bend.
    //
    // IT SATURATES BY CONSTRUCTION. sin0 peaks at horizontal and eases off past it, which is what a real
    // toe-touch does -- the trunk ends up hanging nearly straight down, so its forward lever arm shrinks back
    // toward zero even though the fold got deeper. The crouch sit-back it composes with (BasisCrouchOffsetCore)
    // has the opposite failure: it is driven by head HEIGHT, so it cannot tell a squat from a waist-fold and
    // runs away linearly at depth. Weighting one by FlexionFrac and the other by (1 - FlexionFrac) lets each
    // own the posture it actually describes.
    //
    // THE DIRECTION IS THE LEAN'S OWN, not the pelvis' facing. Counterbalance opposes the direction the mass
    // actually went, so a forward-left fold is answered back-right. Using a bone axis would only handle pure
    // sagittal bends AND would drag in the bind-frame problem that has bitten this file repeatedly (a bone's
    // local axes are a rig convention). Derived from positions alone, this is equivariant by construction.
    //
    // GATING lives in the job: no hip tracker. A tracked pelvis is measured and must feed straight through --
    // same contract as ApplyHipHinge and the hip-bob synthesis.
