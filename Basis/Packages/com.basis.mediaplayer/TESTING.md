# Testing the media player

How to test changes to `com.basis.mediaplayer` without fooling yourself. The README describes
what the player does; this describes how to prove it still does it after your change.

There is no automated test suite for playback — the player's job is realtime A/V against real
networks and real hardware decoders, and regressions live exactly in the parts a mock can't
reach. Testing is therefore structured manual verification: known-good streams, a repeatable
matrix, and evidence capture.

Playback is only half of it. The native plugin parses attacker-controlled container and
protocol bytes in-process, so a change under `Native~/` carries a security exposure that a
playback matrix does not cover. If you are touching the C core, read
[Native plugin changes: the security boundary](#native-plugin-changes-the-security-boundary)
first — it sets the threat model and the malformed-input and fuzz testing that a parser change
needs, over and above "a good file still plays."

## Rule zero: prove the feed before you blame the player

Most "player bugs" found during development turn out to be feeder problems: a stalled stream,
an under-provisioned link, a server that lied about ranges. A player symptom only earns
player-side investigation once the feed is proven healthy — probe it with something that isn't
the player first:

```
# Stream shape + first decodable frame (RTSP; works for any transport ffmpeg speaks)
ffprobe -rtsp_transport tcp -show_entries stream=codec_type,codec_name,channels rtsp://host:8554/path

# Wall-time to first video frame — long GOPs make mid-stream joins slow by nature
ffmpeg -v error -rtsp_transport tcp -i <url> -map 0:v:0 -frames:v 1 -f null -
```

Things that regularly masquerade as player bugs:

- **Link capacity.** A 28 Mbps stream over a 22 Mbps path cannot play live, and no player-side
  change will fix it. Measure the actual path throughput before investigating stutter (on
  Windows, `curl.exe` under-reads badly — use a timed `urllib` read from Python instead).
- **Mid-GOP joins.** Joining a live stream between keyframes delivers audio immediately and no
  video until the next IDR. With a 10-second GOP that is a 10-second "video hang" that is
  entirely the source's fault. Know your test stream's GOP.
- **Single-client feeders.** `ffmpeg -listen 1` serves one client, then lingers in a stale
  state that trickles junk. If a second connection behaves strangely, restart the feeder.
- **Wrong delivery detection.** `Delivery = Auto` probes `Range: bytes=0-` and needs a real
  `206 Partial Content` to detect on-demand content. `python -m http.server` and
  `ffmpeg -listen` answer `200` and get treated as **live**. Serve VOD files from nginx (or
  anything with real range support).

Script these probes over whatever endpoints you use before a test session — a stalled or
mis-configured feed wastes far more time than the 30 seconds a probe takes.

## Where test streams may live (the security gates)

`BasisMediaPlayerSecurity` validates every URL before the engine opens it
(`Runtime/Core/BasisMediaPlayerSecurity.cs`). The rules shape where your streams must run:

| Rule | Effect on testing |
| --- | --- |
| Loopback: **Editor only, and only with the opt-in** | `localhost` works for fast in-editor iteration *if* `BASIS_MEDIA_ALLOW_LOCAL` is set for that Editor process (see the native re-check row below). Without it, or in a build, it is refused — and that refusal is correct, not a regression |
| Every other non-global-unicast address: **always blocked** | RFC1918 (`192.168.*`, `10.*`, `172.16-31.*`), CGNAT, link-local, and the IANA special-use reserves (TEST-NET, benchmarking, 6to4 relay). No env var relaxes the C# gate for these, so LAN servers never work, Editor included — don't bother. Loopback is the one exception, and only as described in the row above |
| Hostnames are DNS-validated, fail-closed | A name that resolves to any of the above (or doesn't resolve) is refused |
| Scheme allowlist | `http`, `https`, `rtsp`, `rtspt`, `rtmp`, `rtmps`, `rist` — anything else (incl. `file://`) is refused. Passing the gate isn't the same as playable, though: `rtmps` (RTMP-over-TLS) is allowlisted but the player rejects it (use `rtmp://`, or an https fMP4/TS URL), and `rist` only works in the opt-in `-DBASIS_WITH_RIST=ON` build |

Practical consequences:

- **Editor iteration:** point at a public endpoint, or run your own server (RTSP/RTMP/HTTP) locally
  and use `localhost` URLs. A local server needs `BASIS_MEDIA_ALLOW_LOCAL` set for the Editor
  process before you launch it — on every transport, not just the native ones. Without it the
  refusal is correct behaviour, and it reads exactly like a transport regression if you aren't
  expecting it.
- **Builds, Quest, multi-client tests:** the stream must come from a **publicly reachable host, or a
  public IP literal** — a public endpoint below, or your own content on any cheap VPS. Where a
  *hostname* is used it must resolve in real DNS (the gate is fail-closed on lookup). A bare public
  IP literal is legitimate and is required by one of the redirect rows below, so don't read "real
  DNS" as "a name is mandatory".
- **Quest/Android:** the OS cleartext policy blocks plain `http://` on the JNI fetch path —
  HTTP-TS and HLS lanes need `https://` with a certificate chain the device actually trusts
  (serve the full chain; standalone headsets are missing more roots than desktop browsers).
  `rtsp://` is unaffected.
- **Native local-address re-check (every transport):** the C# gate above is the first line and is
  **not** affected by the env var below — a top-level RFC1918 URL stays refused by C# regardless,
  and a top-level `localhost` URL works only in the Editor (the C# rule). Behind it, the native
  layer independently re-checks resolved addresses for everything it opens: RTSP/RTMP (via
  `basis_io`), every HLS playlist/segment fetch (the SSRF re-check that stops a hostile playlist
  steering a sub-resource URI at an internal host), plain HTTP(S) MP4/TS through the platform
  stack, and **every redirect hop** on those HTTP(S) lanes. That native re-check has no Editor
  concept, so it refuses `localhost` (and any private address it is handed directly, e.g. an HLS
  segment URI the C# gate never saw) unless `BASIS_MEDIA_ALLOW_LOCAL` is set (any non-empty value).
  Setting it relaxes **only** that native re-check, not the C# gate — so its practical use is
  running your own server at `localhost` in the Editor, on any transport including plain HTTP(S).
  **Scope it to the Editor session that needs it.** Any non-empty value turns the re-check off for
  every transport and every redirect hop, and a process inherits it from whatever launched it — so
  set it per-run, never machine-wide, and never for a player build or a CI job. Every negative test
  in the security rows below must run with it **unset**, or it passes for the wrong reason: check
  the environment first if a gate that should refuse lets something through.
- The separate world-content trust allowlist (`BasisDefaultTrustedUrls`, https-only) gates the
  sandboxed `VideoPlayer` shim path, not this package — but streams hosted on already-trusted
  domains spare testers a consent prompt when worlds use the same URL.

## Public always-on endpoints (zero setup)

These cover the common lanes without standing up anything. They are third-party services —
fine for interactive test sessions, not for soak loops.

| URL | Exercises | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rtsp://stream.vrcdn.live/live/vrcdn` | RTSP live, H.264 720p + AAC 2.0 @ 48 kHz | VRCDN's own 24/7 channel; the primary PC low-latency lane; host is on the default trust list |
| `https://stream.vrcdn.live/live/vrcdn.live.ts` | MPEG-TS over HTTPS, live | Same channel, the standalone-friendly lane (https, so Quest-safe) |
| `https://www2.iis.fraunhofer.de/AAC/ChID-BLITS-EBU.mp4` | Progressive MP4 VOD, range/`206` | 800x600 (4:3), H.264 + AAC 5.1 @ 44.1 kHz, ~47 s. The seek/pause and delivery auto-detect lane. Doubles as the non-16:9 case — the aspect ratio must be preserved, not stretched to the quad — and as a non-48 kHz source, so it exercises the resample path |
| `https://test-streams.mux.dev/x36xhzz/x36xhzz.m3u8` | HLS VOD, multi-variant master | Exercises the panel's bitrate dropdown |
| [Fraunhofer AAC multichannel page](https://www2.iis.fraunhofer.de/AAC/multichannel.html) | AAC 5.1/7.1 VOD fixtures | Includes adversarial layouts: PCE-signalled 7.1 must fail **gracefully** on Windows (muted audio or a clean error — never a crash) |

> Live endpoints join mid-GOP like any live stream — audio-before-video on join is expected
> behaviour, not a regression, unless the gap exceeds the stream's GOP length.

**Page URLs (YouTube, Twitch, …) are deliberately absent from this guide.** They only work
through an optional resolver integration, so the base package can't assume they're testable.
Everything in this document uses direct stream URLs; resolver-dependent testing lives in the
integration package that provides it — e.g.
[`com.basis.integration.ytdlp/TESTING.md`](../com.basis.integration.ytdlp/TESTING.md).
The same split applies to any future integration: endpoints that need an integration package
to function are tested in that package's own TESTING.md.

## Lanes without a public endpoint: bring your own

The public endpoints above cover the common lanes. The rest — the live transports (RTSP/RTMP/RIST),
split-stream pairs, `localhost` iteration, and a couple of fixtures no public stream carries
reliably (CEA-608 captions, LPCM 7.1 over M2TS) — you provide yourself. There is no bundled
test-server stack to maintain; stand up whatever server you already use and point your own files at
it.

What the manual pass is actually for: the CI conformance gate (`tools/media-conformance`) already
proves the **demuxers** parse every supported container/codec correctly — on synthetic fixtures, on
every native change. What it cannot touch is real **decode + present** on actual hardware, A/V sync,
and the live network transports. That is exactly what this matrix covers, and it needs real files
and servers.

Supported inputs to keep on hand (generate with `ffmpeg`, serve however you like):

- **Containers:** MP4 / fragmented MP4 (`.mp4` `.m4v` `.m4a` `.m4s`), MPEG-TS (`.ts`) and
  Blu-ray/AVCHD M2TS (`.m2ts` `.mts`), WebM/Matroska (`.webm`), Ogg (`.opus`), MP3 (`.mp3`),
  WAV (`.wav`), HLS (`.m3u8`, TS- or fMP4-segmented).
- **Video codecs:** H.264, H.265/HEVC (`hvc1`), VP9 (WebM and `vp09`-in-MP4), AV1 (progressive and
  fragmented MP4, and `V_AV1` WebM).
- **Audio codecs:** AAC (≤ 5.1 on Windows, discrete 5.1 on Android), Opus (WebM and Ogg), MP3 (bare,
  and `esds` OTI `0x6B`/`0x69` in MP4), LPCM (WAV, and 7.1 over M2TS).
- **Transports:** any RTSP/RTMP server (e.g. MediaMTX), an `ffmpeg`-served HTTP-TS feed, nginx (or
  anything with real `Range`/`206` support) for VOD, an HLS packager, and — for the opt-in
  `-DBASIS_WITH_RIST=ON` build — a RIST sender (ffmpeg/librist), plain and AES.

Two feeder traps worth repeating: a VOD host must answer `206 Partial Content` or `Delivery=Auto`
mis-detects it as live (`python -m http.server` and `ffmpeg -listen` answer `200` — use nginx); and
for A/V-sync work use **real footage with visible lip-sync**, not synthetic patterns.

## The regression matrix

Run the rows your change plausibly touches; run everything before a release-bound merge.
"Verify" always includes: plays within a sane time, A/V stays in sync, no console errors
(`BasisDebug` tag `Video`), clean stop/unload.

### Transports

| Lane | Source | Verify additionally |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RTSP live | VRCDN, or your own RTSP server (e.g. MediaMTX) | Join latency ≈ GOP-bound; pause/resume recovers cleanly. `rtsp://` negotiates UDP transport first and falls back to TCP-interleaved; the Console logs the settled choice once per load (`[NativeMedia] transport: RTSP over UDP`), and it's queryable via `BasisMediaPlayer.CurrentTransport` |
| RTSP adversarial join | your own RTSP server fed a long-GOP source | Audio leads video by up to the GOP length on join, then locks — no permanent desync |
| RTSP refusal fallback | your own RTSP server configured TCP-only (`rtspTransports: [tcp]` in MediaMTX) | UDP SETUP is refused (461); playback is indistinguishable from today, no error surfaced; Console logs `RTSP over TCP (UDP unavailable)` |
| RTSP timer fallback | any network that silently drops the RTP UDP ports (`8000-8001/udp`) | First join stalls ~3 s, then restarts transparently over TCP with the same fallback log line; a reload of the same host skips the probe and goes straight to TCP |
| RTSP forced TCP | `rtspt://` form of any RTSP URL | No UDP attempt at all (no UDP `SETUP` in the server log); Console logs `RTSP over TCP` |
| HTTP-TS live | VRCDN `.live.ts`, or your own `ffmpeg`-served TS | Same checks over plain TS; on Quest use the https lane |
| HLS VOD | Mux master, or your own HLS packaging | Variant switch via panel bitrate dropdown mid-play |
| Progressive/fMP4 MP4 | Fraunhofer ChID-BLITS, or your own MP4 with *working* byte ranges — a `Range` request must answer `206` with a valid `Content-Range`, not merely advertise `Accept-Ranges: bytes` | `Delivery=Auto` detects OnDemand; seek slider works; 4:3 source keeps its aspect on the quad rather than stretching. Advertising alone still reads as on-demand for pacing but refuses to seek, so a host that advertises and then serves `200` looks like a player bug and isn't. Integrated fMP4 has its own `global_sidx` recipe under **Seek (integrated fMP4)** below |
| RTMP | your own RTMP server (e.g. MediaMTX) | Minimal client — plain `rtmp://` pull only |
| RIST plain + AES | your own RIST sender (ffmpeg/librist) | Requires RIST-enabled plugin build; loss recovery under induced packet loss |
| WAV audio-only | your own WAV over HTTP | 16/24-bit, up to 8 ch; no video track is not an error |
| Split-stream | your own video-only + audio-only pair | Windows-only today; `AudioUri` lane syncs to video |

### Content and codecs

No public host carries every codec in every container flavour, so generate these from a CC
clip — any Blender open movie, from [Blender Studio's films](https://studio.blender.org/films/) — with
the `ffmpeg` recipe in each row. `in.mp4` below is that source clip. For higher-res / 4K masters,
[media.xiph.org](https://media.xiph.org/) mirrors the Blender films losslessly (e.g. Sintel 4K at
`https://media.xiph.org/sintel/sintel-4k.y4m.xz`, and `sintel-4k-png/` frame sets) — grab one and
cut a short segment (`ffmpeg -i sintel-4k.y4m -t 20 -c copy in4k.y4m`). (The demux side is already
covered bit-for-bit by the CI conformance gate; these rows are the real decode + present pass.)

| Fixture | Verify |
| --- | --- |
| H.264 + AAC stereo | The baseline — everything else assumes this passes |
| H.265/HEVC | **Video actually appears** (`ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -c:v libx265 -tag:v hvc1 -c:a aac hevc.mp4` — `hvc1` from stock libx265, what most HEVC in the wild is). Check for frames, not for the absence of an error: `hvc1` keeps its parameter sets only in the `hvcC` box, so anything that loses them on the way to the decoder gives a black screen with no error raised and nothing in the Console. Absence of the codec is the other half of the row — without the HEVC Video Extension installed it must degrade cleanly, and testing only that half will pass while playback is comprehensively broken |
| VP9 in WebM (`ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 0 -crf 32 -c:a libopus vp9.webm`; two-pass for superframes) | Plays on Windows (Store "VP9 Video Extensions" + a GPU with hardware VP9 — the probe gates both) and Quest (hardware everywhere). A two-pass encode carries superframes, so whole-superframe feeding is exercised by playing it |
| VP9 in MP4 (`ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -c:v libvpx-vp9 -c:a aac vp9.mp4`; modern ffmpeg writes the `vp09` sample entry) | The `vp09` sample-entry lane; same decode path as WebM |
| AV1 in progressive MP4 (`ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -c:v libaom-av1 -crf 30 -c:a aac av1.mp4`) | Plays with video on Windows (Store "AV1 Video Extension" + a GPU with hardware AV1 — RTX 30+/RX 6000+/Arc; the probe gates both) and Quest 3. AV1-in-MP4 historically misplayed as silent audio-only |
| AV1 in fragmented MP4 (the AV1 MP4 recipe + `-movflags frag_keyframe+empty_moov`) | The `av1C`-in-`stsd` fMP4 walk with the configOBU first-AU prepend |
| AV1 4K (a 2160p slice of Sintel 4K — see the intro above — through the AV1 MP4 recipe) | 2160p decode + ring memory on both platforms |
| AV1 in WebM (the AV1 recipe with `av1.webm`) | The `V_AV1` CodecID lane (CodecPrivate = av1C record → configOBU extradata); duration + Cues seek work as for VP9 |
| AV1 extension absent (Windows) | Uninstall/absent "AV1 Video Extension": a direct `av01` URL errors with the install hint, and the probe answers 0 so the resolver never offers AV1 |
| AV1 on Quest 2 | No AV1 decoder on the device: a direct `av01` URL refuses cleanly, and YouTube resolution still succeeds via the VP9 lane (its probe passes there) |
| Opus in muxed WebM (`ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -c:v libvpx-vp9 -c:a libopus vp9_opus.webm`) | VP9 video + Opus audio in one file: plays whole with audio on Windows and Quest. Exercises the two-track WebM demux (blocks routed to video vs audio by TrackNumber) |
| Opus audio-only WebM (`ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -vn -c:a libopus opus.webm`) | An `A_OPUS`-only WebM (YouTube's audio itags 249/250/251): audio plays with no video, driven by the audio-only contract |
| Opus decode on Windows | Native via the libopus that `com.avionblock.opussharp` ships, runtime-loaded (no Store extension, unlike VP9/AV1). Confirm audio plays in the Editor (the library resolves from the opussharp `Packages/…` path) and in a build (`opus.dll` flattened beside the plugin). If opussharp is absent the format is refused: muted audio, video unaffected, never a crash |
| Opus on Quest | Native `audio/opus` MediaCodec with OpusHead + pre-skip/pre-roll csd; gapless start sane, audio-only path works |
| Ogg Opus file (`.opus`) | A `.opus` URL routes as directly-playable (no resolver) and plays: the Ogg demuxer walks pages/lacing, verifies each page CRC, reads OpusHead, and feeds the same Opus decoder. A `.opus` with a damaged page resyncs on the next `OggS` rather than failing |
| Ogg Opus seek (`.opus`) | On a range/`206` host, a `.opus` file reports its duration (a seek bar appears) and seeks — Ogg has no index, so seek is granule bisection over the byte range; it lands at page granularity near the target and resumes. A live/no-range source has no seek bar (duration 0), which is correct. Check the Editor (Windows) |
| Unsupported video codec | VP8 (`ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -c:v libvpx vp8.webm`) and MPEG-4 Part 2 (`ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -c:v mpeg4 mp4v.mp4`) refuse with a clear "video codec 'x' is not supported" error naming the codec — never silent audio under a black screen |
| VP9/AV1 software-fallback guard | On a GPU without hardware decode for the profile, a direct VP9/AV1 URL must produce the "video decoder produced software frames" error, not a black screen (the Store MFTs silently fall back to CPU — for AV1 that is the *majority* of pre-RTX-30 desktops; only reproducible on a no-hw box or with the extension's fallback forced) |
| AAC decoder priming | Audio starts on the first real sample, not on the decoder's priming. AAC's encoder delay is one 1024-sample frame, which MP4 signals with an edit list (`elst media_time=1024` on anything `ffmpeg -c:a aac` produced); the samples ahead of that origin must not reach the output. **Do not try to hear this** — 21 ms of lag is below the lip-sync threshold, which is exactly why it went unnoticed for so long. Measure it: decode the file with `ffmpeg -i x.m4a -map a:0 -f f32le -acodec pcm_f32le ref.f32`, capture what the player served, and cross-correlate. Assert on the **peak's sample offset**, not a correlation value: aligned output peaks at offset 0, a stream still carrying its priming peaks at offset 1024 (the edit-list delay) — the actual defect, and reliable regardless of content, channels, or capture. (The absolute coefficient at offset 0 is content-dependent — a shifted stream reads roughly -0.07 on this fixture, but do not gate on that number.) An LPCM/WAV file is the control — no decoder, no priming, peaks at offset 0 |
| AAC 5.1 | Windows MF decodes ≤ 5.1; correct channel mapping (use content with known channel placement, judge by ear per output speaker) |
| AAC 5.1 in a progressive MP4 (Android) | Decodes to discrete 5.1, not silence. Generate a 5.1 AAC MP4 (`ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -c:a aac -ac 6 aac51.mp4`). The esds can carry an inert SBR sync extension the Android decoder otherwise rejects (`aacDecoder 0x1001` in logcat) — that extension is encoder-dependent, so use a clip that carries it when chasing that path |
| MP3 bare stream (`.mp3`) | CBR and VBR play forward; a leading `ID3v2` tag is skipped and a Xing/Info/VBRI header frame is dropped (not heard as a click). Duration is reported from the header's frame count and the seek slider works. Windows uses the in-box Media Foundation MP3 decoder, Quest the `audio/mpeg` MediaCodec. Generate fixtures with `ffmpeg -i src.wav -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 192k cbr.mp3` and `-q:a 2 vbr.mp3` |
| MP3 in MP4/M4A | An `mp4a` sample entry whose `esds` object-type-indication is `0x6B`/`0x69` plays as MP3, not misdetected as AAC (`ffmpeg -i cbr.mp3 -c copy out.m4a`) |
| LPCM 7.1 M2TS | All 8 lanes audible and correctly placed — the only full-7.1 path on Windows |
| PCE-signalled / >6-ch AAC | **Graceful refusal** on Windows (mute or clean error, never a crash) |
| Trailing-moov progressive MP4 | Non-faststart file (`ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -c copy out.mp4` leaves `moov` after `mdat`): on a range/`206` server it plays with seek + duration; over a one-way stream (no ranges) it refuses cleanly with a faststart-remux hint |
| CEA-608 captions | A caption-bearing TS you generate (no public stream carries captions reliably): cues appear on time, accented characters correct, clear-cue clears, CC toggle + opacity sliders live-apply |
| 44.1 kHz audio | Resamples cleanly to the DSP rate (dominant path is 48 kHz — don't let 44.1k rot) |
| Non-16-aligned coded height | No pad strip on the video edge (a thin top strip on Windows, a grey bottom strip on Android) and the RenderTexture matches the display aspect. 720p and other 16-aligned heights are clean, so test a padded height specifically — 1080p (→1088) on Windows, 640×360 (→368) on Android |
| Mid-stream resolution change | The visible size changing part-way through a single elementary stream — ordinary content (a new SPS), and the only thing that makes the backend tear down and rebuild its shared output texture while playing. No public endpoint does it on demand, so build one: encode slices of the same clip at two sizes (`-vf scale=1280:534` and `-vf scale=640:268`) to MPEG-TS, each with `-output_ts_offset <start>` so timestamps stay continuous across the join, then concatenate the parts bytewise. Alternate every couple of seconds so one play-through covers a dozen switches. Video keeps playing across every switch and settles at each new size, with no black or stretched frame held, no frame torn between the two sizes, and no crash. Confirm the fixture really switches before trusting a pass — `ffprobe -v error -select_streams v:0 -show_frames -show_entries frame=width,height -of csv=p=0 <fixture.ts> \| sort -u` must report both sizes (`-show_entries` only selects fields; without `-show_frames` there are no frame sections to select from, so the command prints nothing and a broken fixture looks the same as a good one). Windows D3D11 and D3D12 (`-force-d3d12`) reach this through separate texture paths, so run both; Android takes a Unity-owned RenderTexture instead and re-sizes it from C# |

### Platforms and backends

| Target | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Windows D3D11 | Default editor/player path |
| Windows D3D12 | Launch with `-force-d3d12`; shared-handle texture path is separate code — video must appear, no `dxgi-fmt` errors in the log |
| Android/Quest | Vulkan path, `AMediaCodec`; https for TS/HLS lanes; check `adb logcat` for codec errors; AAC 5.1 arrives in WAVE order. 5.1 AAC in a progressive MP4 decodes discretely (see the codec row); the coded-height pad is cropped off the present (grey bottom strip) |
| Desktop ↔ VR swap | Toggle mode mid-playback — the external texture must survive the graphics-device swap |
| Linux via Proton/Wine | The Windows build under a compatibility layer. No lane here can stand in for it: the plugin runs against Wine's reimplementations of WinHTTP, Media Foundation and D3D11, so behaviour can differ from native Windows even though the binary is identical. Loading the plugin at all is gated behind a one-off prompt (Media Foundation may be absent). Verify a VOD plays at 1x rather than racing through the content — delivery pacing depends on the seekability probe reading Content-Length, and a probe failure shows up as synchronised fast-forward at roughly the download-speed-over-bitrate ratio. Confirm the seek slider works and that a late joiner syncing to a mid-VOD playhead lands at the right position, since both need the same probe. Testing this needs a real Proton user; there is no rig for it here |

### Behaviour checklists

**Playback lifecycle** — load → play → pause → resume → stop → replay same URL → load a
different URL mid-play. No stale frames, no orphaned audio, position resets correctly.

**Seek (VOD)** — slider to arbitrary positions; rapid successive seeks (input is debounced);
seek-then-pause shows the sought frame. The byte-source ranged refetch that backs a seek now
runs on **Android** too (JNI `HttpsURLConnection`), not just Windows — run the same slider
checks on a Quest against a range/`206` VOD host (`https://`), watching `adb logcat` for a clean
reposition (no decoder error, playback resumes at the target). A container seek repositions to
the sync point at or before the target and the run-up from there is decoded but never shown, so
playback lands **at the requested position** — never visibly replaying from the keyframe, and
never crawling the gap at 1x. The adversarial case is a **sparse-keyframe file** (tens of
seconds per GOP, e.g. a low-motion screen capture): a mid-GOP seek there should recover after a
short silent pause that scales with decode speed, not with the distance seeked.

**Seek (HLS-TS VOD)** — on the Mux master (`https://test-streams.mux.dev/x36xhzz/x36xhzz.m3u8`),
seek both directions and confirm playback resumes **paced at 1x from the target**: a forward
seek must not freeze for the jump distance, and a backward seek must not fast-forward through
the intervening segments back to the pre-seek position. The segment producer repositions at
segment granularity but the landing is **target-exact**: the run-up from the segment boundary
to the target is decoded and discarded, so playback must resume at the requested position, not
the start of the containing segment. A mis-anchored pace clock (stall forward / flood backward)
is the failure to watch for. Also seek **from the tail**: once the fetcher has downloaded every
remaining segment (the last buffer's worth of the stream, so roughly the final ten seconds of a
short VOD) it parks rather than exits, and a backward seek from there must still reposition —
a bar that flashes the target and snaps forward means the parked-fetcher revival broke. Playing
through to the end must present the tail before ENDED is raised: the position walks all the way
to the true duration and the final content is actually shown and heard — ENDED firing early
while banked audio or video is discarded is the failure. Shared clock, so check both the Editor
(Windows) and Quest.

**Seek (integrated fMP4)** — on a self-contained fragmented MP4 (moof/mdat fragments indexed by a
top-level `sidx`) served from a range/`206` host. Produce one from a CC clip:
`ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -c copy -movflags +frag_keyframe+empty_moov+global_sidx out.mp4` (the `global_sidx`
box is what the byte-source seek indexes). Confirm
`Delivery=Auto` detects OnDemand and seeks in both directions reposition cleanly and resume at the
target with no decoder error. This is the `sidx`-driven byte-source reseek; it shares the
byte-source seek path with progressive/trailing-moov MP4, so a regression here usually surfaces on
those too. Distinct from fMP4 carried *in HLS*, which isn't seekable — a mid-fragment ring flush
can't resynchronise the box parser. Check the Editor (Windows) and Quest.

**Seek (WebM Cues)** — on your VP9 WebM fixture (the codec-row recipe; a `libvpx-vp9` encode
carries Cues) served from a range/`206` host, seek both directions: playback lands at or just
before the target (cue/cluster granularity, on a keyframe) and resumes paced at 1x — the same
stall-forward / flood-backward failure shapes as the HLS row apply. Seek near the very end of the
file as well (EOS race). A cueless variant (`-cues_to_front 0`, or strip the Cues) must show no
seek bar at all. Your AV1 WebM fixture rides the same cue walk with the AV1 branch — one
both-directions pass there covers it. Check the Editor (Windows) and Quest.

**Seek (MP3)** — on a `.mp3` VOD over a range/`206` server, seek both directions and near the
end. MP3 seek is inherently approximate (no per-frame timestamps): CBR lands within a frame via
the bitrate mapping, VBR uses the Xing TOC, so the playhead may land a fraction of a second off
the slider — that is expected, a permanent desync or a stall is not. A `.mp3` with no Xing/Info
header reports no duration and shows no seek bar.

**Networking** — two clients minimum: owner loads URL → both play; non-owner requests control
→ ownership transfers; owner pause/stop propagates; late joiner receives current state; each
client resolves the URL independently (per-client CDN/bitrate differences are fine, state
divergence is not). End-of-stream is per-client: a late joiner runs behind the owner by its
join latency and must play through to its own end of the content — the owner finishing first
must not cut it off. Clients therefore finish at slightly different wall-clock times; a peer
stopping short of the end is the failure, synchronised finishes are not expected.

**Networked audio-only** — the same two-client setup with an audio-only URL (`.wav`, `.mp3`,
`.m4a`, `.opus`). These carry no video track, so anything that waits on a video frame or an
output texture never fires for them, and a readiness regression here is invisible on the
owner's own client — it plays locally either way. Load one while the peers are mid-playback of
something else: they must switch to it, not carry on and then resume the old source when it
ends. Check the peer starts near the beginning rather than at the outgoing video's playhead,
and that a late joiner receives it too. Worth a pass on a peer with
`AutoPlayOnSourceAssigned` unticked, which is the case that relies on the owner's advertised
state rather than local autoplay.

**Audio source controls and filters** — `AudioSource.volume` and `.mute` are per output, not
per player: with a stream playing, drag one output's `Volume` to zero and back and only that
source's level moves, and `Mute` silences that source alone. The player-wide controls are
`BasisMediaPlayerAudio`'s `VolumeGain` / `Mute` (what the panel slider drives), and the three
multiply. The multichannel prefab is the row that matters here — set each of the eight outputs
to a different level and confirm the balance holds, rather than one slider dragging the rest
with it. Then add an `Audio Low Pass Filter` (or Reverb / Chorus) to one of the output
GameObjects and confirm it colours that output. Unity applies filters in component order and
the `BasisMediaPlayerAudioTap` is what generates the audio, so a filter moved **above** the tap
is expected to do nothing; the check is that one added normally, below it, is heard. Drag a
filter above the tap and both the tap's own inspector and the owning `BasisMediaPlayerAudio`
should say so and offer to fix it, without either needing a reselect to notice. On a prefab
instance the tap itself can't move, so the fix lowers the filters below it instead — with two
filters stacked, check they keep their order relative to each other, since swapping them
changes the chain. Only when neither move is allowed should the notice say to open the prefab.
That notice is also what a hand-built output rig relies on, so add a bare AudioSource with a
filter on it to `Outputs` and confirm it's flagged. A rig assembled in code can't be reordered
at all once play starts, so build one that way (AudioSource plus a filter, added to `Outputs`
from a script) and confirm the player logs a warning naming the filter rather than failing
quietly. Two AudioSource controls are expected to
misbehave and shouldn't be reported as regressions: `Pitch` does nothing, and ticking `Bypass
Effects` or unticking `Spatialize Post Effects` drops spatialisation to flat 2D, because the
spatialiser then runs ahead of the tap and its output is overwritten.

**Audio analysis feed** — Unity's per-source readback (`AudioSource.GetOutputData` and the
spectrum calls behind it) only reflects clip playback, so an output the tap drives reads back as
silence and anything sampling that AudioSource — AudioLink, VU meters, spectrum-driven world
scripts — sees nothing. `Analysis Feed` on that output's `BasisMediaAudioChannel` swaps it to a clip the
player writes, which Unity does read back. The row to run is AudioLink: add its `AudioLinkInput`
AudioSource to `Outputs` with a `BasisMediaAudioChannel` set to `Stereo (downmix)` and
`Analysis Feed` ticked, point AudioLink's `audioSource` at it, and confirm the AudioLink texture
tracks the stream. Untick it and reactivity should stop, which is the control for the whole
mechanism. Only that output changes: the speakers stay on the tap, so check A/V sync on them is
no different with the feed on. The feed runs `Feed Delay` behind the tap-driven outputs, so
reactivity trails the sound by that much — check it looks in time at the default and lower it
until it breaks up to find the floor on the platform under test. It's written once a frame, so
the floor moves with the frame rate; a rig that holds at 0.02s on desktop may need more on a
headset. The filter-order notices don't apply to
an analysis output, since it isn't generating into the DSP block, so confirm a filter added there
is heard and isn't flagged. The analyser still won't hear that filter: the readback is taken from
clip playback, upstream of the filter chain, so a low pass on an analysis output colours what you
hear and nothing of what AudioLink sees. Worth one pass on Quest, where the DSP runs at a different rate to
the stream and the clip path leans on Unity's own resampling rather than the tap's.

**Panel UI** ("Media Players" panel, `Runtime/UI/BasisMediaPlayerPanelProvider.cs`) — URL
load, transport buttons, seek slider (VOD only), volume, bitrate dropdown (HLS multi-variant),
audio-track dropdown (multi-audio content), captions toggle + opacity sliders, subtitles
dropdown (only when the loaded media offers sidecar subtitle tracks — resolver-supplied, so
the scenarios live in the resolver package's guide; with plain stream URLs the dropdown must
be entirely absent). Controls that don't apply to the loaded media should be absent or inert,
not broken.

**Security gates** — negative tests matter: `http://192.168.1.10/x.ts` must refuse with a
clear reason on every platform (that RFC1918 refusal is the C# gate and holds regardless of any
env var); a plain HTTP(S) `localhost` MP4/TS URL must refuse **in a build**; `file:///` must
refuse. `localhost` in the Editor is refused on every lane — HTTP(S) as well as HLS, RTSP and
RTMP — unless `BASIS_MEDIA_ALLOW_LOCAL` relaxes the native re-check (see the security-gates
section above); a refusal there without the opt-in is correct, not a regression.
A regression that *opens* a gate is a security bug — flag it as such, not as a playback bug.

**HLS sub-resource SSRF** — the URL gate only sees the top-level playlist, so the native
source re-checks each URI a playlist steers it to. Serve a media `.m3u8` from a public host
whose segment (or `EXT-X-MAP`, or a nested variant) URI is an absolute
`http://169.254.169.254/…` / `http://192.168.x.x/…` / `http://127.0.0.1:PORT/…`: playback must
fail rather than issue that fetch (watch the target server's logs — the internal host must see no
request). A playlist that reaches an internal host is a security regression, not a broken-stream
bug. (Editor testing of the legitimate localhost lane needs `BASIS_MEDIA_ALLOW_LOCAL` — see the
security-gates section above.)

**Redirect SSRF** — the C# gate only ever sees the entry URL, so the native source re-validates
the target of every `3xx` hop. Serve a public URL that answers `302 Location:` pointing at an
internal target: playback must fail and the internal listener must see **no connection at all**.
That is a refusal you can only confirm by watching the target, since a followed-then-failed hop
looks identical from the client — judge on the listener, never on the error message.

Cover both address families, because they go through different branches of the guard and the
platform URL parsers hand an IPv6 host back in brackets where an IPv4 one has none:

| Redirect target | Catches |
| --- | --- |
| `https://127.0.0.1:PORT/…` | IPv4 loopback |
| `http://192.168.x.x/…` | RFC1918 |
| `http://169.254.169.254/…` | link-local / cloud metadata |
| `https://[::1]:PORT/…` | IPv6 loopback |
| `https://[fd00::1]/…` | IPv6 ULA |
| `https://[fe80::1]/…` | IPv6 link-local — **confirmatory only, see below** |
| a public hostname resolving to a private address | resolved-address checking, not string matching |
| a hostname answering with **both** a public and a private address | any private answer must block the name outright |
| `file:///C:/Windows/win.ini` as the `Location` | the scheme allow-list, which runs **after** the hop is resolved |
| `ftp://ftp.example.com/x.ts` as the `Location` | the same, on a scheme that is neither local nor http |
| an `https` entry URL answering `302 Location: http://public-host/…` | the transport downgrade — the body must not silently fall back to plaintext |

The two scheme rows look redundant against a guard that only ever fetches over HTTP, and they are
not: both platforms resolve a hop with the OS URL machinery (`UrlCombineW`, `java.net.URL`), and
both will carry a foreign scheme straight through from a `Location` that supplies one. The
allow-list therefore has to run after the resolve, and nothing else in this matrix exercises that
ordering — a regression in it would pass every other row here.

The downgrade row needs its own witness, because a plaintext target is an ordinary public host that
the address policy is right to allow — nothing about the refusal is visible from the client. Point
the `Location` at a plain-HTTP listener you control and watch it: a connection means the hop was
followed and the media would have travelled in the clear. Note that an `http` *entry* URL is still
allowed; it is only the https→http transition that must be refused.

The two IPv6 link-local and ULA rows are **confirmatory, not discriminating**, and should be
recorded as such. Neither address is routable from a test machine — `fe80::1` has no zone index, so
it cannot be reached even by a client with no guard at all — which means a refusal proves the
request stopped, not that the address policy is what stopped it. Adding an RFC 6874 zone
(`https://[fe80::1%25<zone>]/…`) would make it routable and therefore discriminating, but the zone
is host-specific and differs between Windows and Android, so there is no portable fixture. Check
these against the guard directly instead: it refuses the bare, raw-zone (`fe80::1%1`) and
percent-encoded (`fe80::1%251`) forms alike, which is the part a regression would break.

The mixed-answer row needs a zone you can edit: give one name a working public `A` and a private
`AAAA` at the same time. **Watch both addresses and require that neither is contacted.** Watching
only the private one makes the result depend on connection order — an implementation that stops at
the first usable answer could connect to the *public* address and the private listener would stay
silent, which reads as a pass. It isn't: the rule is that any private answer blocks the whole name,
so a correct client contacts neither. The public side is easy to watch if you own the host — its
own access log is the witness. It is worth the setup, because it is the row a plausible-looking
guard fails. If you can't set it up, say so rather than ticking it.

The mirror case — a **public** IPv6 literal must still be allowed, since it fails closed if bracket
handling regresses — is worth covering end-to-end where you can. `https://[2606:…]/` needs a host on
a public IPv6 address serving over a certificate with an IP SAN. Let's Encrypt has issued those for
both IPv4 and IPv6 since January 2026, under its short-lived (~6 day) profile, so the certificate is
no longer the obstacle: an IPv6-reachable host is. Standing one up exercises bracket parsing, the
address policy, TLS and the hop loop together, which nothing else in this matrix does. Where no such
host is available, check that case against the guard directly and record that the stream lane was
skipped — a guard check does not cover the TLS and parsing half.

Legitimate redirects must still play, which is the half that catches an over-tight fix: check an
absolute **same-host, same-scheme** `302`, a two-hop chain, and a relative `Location` (both `/path`
and `../path`). Same-scheme is load-bearing in that sentence — "same host" alone would include the
https→http case the row above requires to be refused. An `http`→`https` **upgrade** is allowed and
is worth checking separately; only the downgrade is refused. A self-redirect must terminate rather
than spin.

**RIST host SSRF** (opt-in `-DBASIS_WITH_RIST=ON` build only) — librist opens and resolves its own
UDP sockets, so the transport sits outside the `basis_io` connect-time guard the other lanes share.
`basis_rist_open` closes that by resolving and vetting the host itself and pinning librist to the
validated address literal. The subtlety when testing it: a `rist://` host is the **entry** URL, so
the C# gate (`BasisMediaPlayerSecurity`) already refuses a literal private target or a hostname that
resolves to a private address before native runs — a plain `rist://192.168.x.x` never reaches
`basis_rist_open` at all, unlike the HLS/redirect lanes where the private target hides in a
sub-resource the C# gate never sees. The native guard is therefore a rebind backstop, exercised only
by a target that passes the C# check but is private by the time native resolves: a DNS-rebinding
fixture whose name answers a public address first and a private one on the next lookup. Point librist
at it and watch the private listener — it must see **no UDP at all**. `BASIS_MEDIA_ALLOW_LOCAL` is
not a way in here: it does not relax the C# gate, so it cannot carry a private literal through to
native. Where no rebind fixture is available, exercise `basis_io_resolve_checked` directly against
the loopback/RFC1918/link-local set and record that the stream lane was skipped. This whole lane
only applies to the RIST-enabled build: in the default build `rist://` still passes the scheme
allowlist (it is listed there), reaches native, and is declined by the stub `basis_rist_open` with
a clear "RIST is not built into this plugin — rebuild with `-DBASIS_WITH_RIST=ON`" error on the sink;
playback fails and the SSRF guard above does not exist in that build.

**The client-side extension gate shapes which redirect fixtures reach native.**
`BasisMediaUrlRouter.IsDirectlyPlayable` requires the URL path to end in a media extension once the
query is stripped, so an extensionless redirect fixture is rejected in C# and never reaches the
native source at all — give the fixture a real media extension on its final path when exercising the
redirect rows. On Android there is no OS-extractor leg: MP4/WebM demux through the same portable path
as Windows, fed by the JNI HTTP source, so the extension you pick selects the container under test,
not a separate code path, and the SSRF hop loop is shared across all of them.

**Android progressive playback and seek** — MP4/WebM demux through the portable path fed by the JNI
HTTP source, so any change to either wants a plain regression pass behind it: play a large
progressive `.mp4` over https, seek forwards and backwards several times, and confirm the position
tracks and audio stays in sync. Use a byte-range server (`206` + a valid `Content-Range`) for the
seek path; the no-`Accept-Ranges` and trailing-moov cases carry their own expectations in the
**Trailing-moov progressive MP4** row above.

**A/V sync judgement** — use real footage with **visible speech**; synthetic patterns hide sync
drift, and Big Buck Bunny has no dialogue at all. A CC-BY Blender open
movie with clear lip-sync is a good source — Sintel and Spring both work; download from
[Blender Studio films](https://studio.blender.org/films/) and re-encode/serve as needed. Watch a
full minute at the live edge, not five seconds. For anything subtle, capture diagnostics (below)
rather than trusting perception.

Know what this row cannot do, and do not treat audibility as the pass bar. A fixed offset
below roughly 45 ms is still a real A/V-sync regression — it is just below the threshold where
watching harder will find it, so this perceptual row structurally cannot see it. Audibility
only explains why manual observation is insufficient here; it is not an acceptance tolerance.
Anything with a constant delay in it (decoder priming, buffer alignment, resampler latency)
must be measured against a reference decode with an explicit tolerance, not signed off by ear.

**Orientation** — a horizontal mirror is invisible on symmetric content. Verify left/right
with on-screen text or a logo, every time video-path code changes.

## Diagnostics and evidence

- **`BasisMediaPlayerDiagnostics`** (`Runtime/BasisMediaPlayerDiagnostics.cs`): add the
  component next to a `BasisMediaPlayer`, enable `AutoStart` (or call `StartLogging()`), and
  it samples ~50 snapshots/s to `Application.persistentDataPath/BasisMediaPlayerDiag.csv`
  (Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\<company>\<product>\`). Useful signals:
  `eng_ttff_ms` (time to first frame), `engine_pos_us` step distribution (late presents show
  as double-steps coinciding with wall-clock gaps), `eng_lag_ms`/`eng_buf_ms` (clock vs
  buffer health), `audio_queue_depth`/`eng_audio_trims` (audio starvation/overrun),
  `cpu_*_drops/skips` (CPU-path frame accounting),
  `eng_rtp_video_gaps`/`eng_rtp_video_drops`/`eng_rtp_audio_gaps` (RTP loss on UDP
  transports). Filter rows to `engine_state == Playing` before drawing conclusions.
- **RTP loss counters**: on `rtsp://` where UDP wins the negotiation, packet loss costs whole
  access units rather than delivery time — a sequence gap taints the AU under assembly and it
  is discarded rather than handed to the decoder incomplete. Queue depths, the present clock
  and `eng_lag_ms` can therefore all look healthy while frames are being dropped. A climbing
  `eng_rtp_video_drops` against a steady `eng_lag_ms` is loss, not starvation, and buffering
  does not address it. These stay at zero on TCP transports, which have no sequence gaps to
  detect.

  They also stay at zero on a native plugin built before the counters existed, because the
  values come from the native side — so a stale binary reports absence of loss rather than
  absence of instrumentation, which is the more dangerous of the two. If a UDP stream is
  visibly dropping frames and all four columns read zero, check the plugin for that platform
  is current before concluding the path is clean.
- **`eng_reasm_video_drops`** counts the other reason an access unit is discarded: reassembly
  failed locally, either an allocation failure or the depacketiser refusing a reassembly past
  its per-AU ceiling. It is deliberately separate from the loss counters because the cause is
  different in kind — it needs no packet loss and fires on any transport, so a run of it points
  at a malformed or hostile source rather than at network conditions. Non-zero here on
  `rtspt://`, which cannot lose packets, always means the source, never the path.
- **Debug window**: `Basis → Debug → Media Player Debug` shows live engine state per player.
- **Feedless harness**: `BasisSyntheticTestSource` (`Runtime/Sources/`) drives the player
  without any network feed — isolates render-path changes from transport noise.
- **Logs**: the package logs exclusively under the `Video` tag via `BasisDebug`. On Android,
  `adb logcat -s Unity` plus the codec tags carry the native side.

## Reporting a regression

A report that can be acted on contains:

1. The exact URL (or how to reproduce the source — server + asset recipe) — full URL, not a fragment
2. Platform, graphics API, Editor-or-build, headset if relevant
3. What was expected, what happened, and how reliably it reproduces
4. Console output around the failure (the `Video`-tagged lines) and, for timing/sync issues,
   the diagnostics CSV covering the incident
5. Whether `ffprobe` of the same URL was green at the time

## Native plugin changes: the security boundary

`Native~/` is where the player is most exposed, and a change there is not verified the same
way a C# change is. The C core parses container and protocol bytes **by hand** — MP4 box
walking (`esds`/`avcc`/`hvcC`), MPEG-TS section parsing, RTSP/RTMP, WebM — and it does so
**in-process, with no sandbox**. The bytes are attacker-controlled: a media URL is opened
from world content and, in multiplayer, broadcast by a peer so that every other client parses
the same hostile stream at once. A parser that reads past a buffer, trusts a length field it
never bounds-checked, or dereferences a pointer it never validated is therefore reachable
remotely, on every client simultaneously.

Two outcomes to test against, in priority order:

- **Denial of service** — the common, proven case. A malformed stream crashes or hangs the
  decode thread and takes the process (editor or client) down with it. This has happened from
  an ordinary `ffmpeg`-produced file: an HEVC elementary stream that reaches the decoder with
  no frame size made the Windows Store HEVC MFT dereference a null pointer on its own worker
  thread. The parser must refuse a sizeless or otherwise under-specified track **before** it
  hands bytes to the decoder, not let it fail somewhere downstream. DoS also covers *resource*
  exhaustion, not just crashes: a size or length field the peer declares must be bounded before
  it drives an allocation or a read loop. The RTMP chunk length, the RTMP per-session buffer
  total, and the RTSP header block and Content-Length are all attacker-declared and now capped;
  a hang counts too — an RTSP server that dribbles an endless header block used to wedge the
  demux thread and, through it, `basis_media_close`. These are exercised by the `fuzz_rtmp` /
  `fuzz_rtsp` targets, not by the playback matrix. **Exactly one of them is gated in CI: the
  RTMP per-message length cap.** `testcases/rtmp/msg_len_alloc_bomb.bin` is replayed under
  `-malloc_limit_mb=8`, and losing that cap turns the run red. **The per-session buffer total
  is *not* gated by it, and the flag cannot gate it**: `-malloc_limit_mb` bounds a single
  allocation, while the session total is only ever reached by accumulating many separate
  `realloc` calls across the 64 chunk-stream slots, none of which need cross 8 MiB. Removing
  `RTMP_MAX_TOTAL` therefore leaves CI green — re-check it by hand when touching the chunk
  reassembler. The **endless-header hang is local-only** for a related reason — the fuzz stub
  is finite and cannot reproduce a hang, which is why it was verified with a standalone server
  harness. Re-run that by hand when touching the RTSP header reader; nothing in CI will catch
  a regression there.
- **Memory corruption** — the worst case, and the reason this is a security boundary and not
  just a stability one. Hand-rolled parsers with untrusted lengths are exactly where
  out-of-bounds reads and writes live. Treat *any* out-of-bounds access as a security bug,
  including a read that "only" crashes — the same missing bound is often writable with a
  different input.

So "a good file still plays" does not verify a parser change. Proving a *hostile* file cannot
crash, hang, or corrupt does.

### What to test after a parser or protocol change

- **Malformed and truncated input, expecting a clean refusal.** For every parser you touch:
  truncate the file mid-box or mid-packet; corrupt a length or size field so it points past
  the buffer; set a dimension, channel count, or entry count to zero or to `UINT32_MAX`; nest
  boxes to absurd depth; point an offset back at itself. The bar is **errors cleanly, never
  crashes or hangs** — a surfaced error string is a pass, a segfault or a spin is a failure.
  Valid-file checks miss all of this by construction; the regressions live in the inputs the
  author didn't picture.
- **Fuzz the demux and parse entry points under sanitizers.** The harness for this lives at
  [`tools/media-fuzz/`](../../../tools/media-fuzz/): coverage-guided libFuzzer targets that
  drive the real `protocol/*.c` readers under AddressSanitizer + UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer,
  no decoder or Unity needed (`./build.sh`, then run a target against a seed corpus). ASan
  turns a silent out-of-bounds read into a named fault with a stack — it is both how you find
  these and how you prove one is gone. An unsanitised "it didn't crash this time" is not proof.
  Fuzzing corrupt input is the single highest-value test this code has; a parser change that
  ships without a fuzz pass is under-tested. When you add a parser, add a `fuzz_<name>.c` target
  beside the others. Targets exist for the container demuxers (TS/MP4/WebM/Ogg/MP3/WAV), the caption
  scanner, the URL parser (`fuzz_url`), the HLS playlist source (`fuzz_hls`), and the RTSP/RTMP
  parsers (`fuzz_rtsp`/`fuzz_rtmp` — their harness `#include`s the real `.c` and stubs `basis_io`,
  byte-serving the read paths; `parse_sdp`/`depkt_*`/`amf_*`/FLV tag parsers are driven directly).
  Deeper full-session coverage (a scripted handshake or an injected transport vtable) is a documented
  follow-up. Still exercise all of these with the adversarial live-server rows above
  (truncated/oversized headers, a server that never sets the RTP marker) — fuzzing complements the
  matrix, it doesn't replace it.
- **Keep every crash's repro as a permanent fixture.** When a malformed stream is found to
  crash, the exact file that triggered it is pinned under `tools/media-fuzz/testcases/` and
  replayed by the `fuzz-demux` CI job (`media-native.yml`) on every native change — a fixed
  memory-safety bug that isn't pinned by a regression repro comes back the next time the
  surrounding code moves.
- **Regress the good path bit-for-bit, not by eye.** A protocol fix on one transport can shift
  the packets another transport emits, because they share the AU path. After any demux change,
  re-run the known-good fixtures and confirm the demuxer still produces the same packets and
  the same decoded frames. `ffprobe -show_packets` alone only compares metadata, not payload, so
  a byte regression with unchanged sizes/timestamps would slip through — the conformance gate
  compares per-packet payload hashes (`-show_data_hash md5`) against ffprobe, and `ffmpeg` frame
  hashes cover pixels. Those hashes are what make "the same" objective instead of "looked fine
  to me."

### Rebuilding and platform coverage

Any change under `Native~/` needs the rebuilt binaries verified on **both** platforms it ships
for (Windows x64 DLL, Android arm64 `.so`) — the shared C core means a protocol fix on one
platform can regress the other, and the malformed-input and fuzz checks above apply to each
backend's decode path (Media Foundation on Windows, `AMediaCodec` on Android) as well as the
shared parsers. See the README's "Building the native plugin" section. Note the Windows DLL
cannot be replaced while any Unity instance holds it loaded — close Unity, swap, reopen.
