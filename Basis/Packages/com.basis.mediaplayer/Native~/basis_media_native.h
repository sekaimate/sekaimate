/*
 * basis_media_native — flat C ABI for OS-codec live media playback.
 *
 * Replaces the previous libvpx VP9 wrapper. There is no embedded codec library:
 * video/audio are decoded by the operating system (Media Foundation on Windows,
 * MediaCodec on Android) and presented zero-copy into a GPU texture that Unity
 * wraps with Texture2D.CreateExternalTexture.
 *
 * The engine owns its own threads: a protocol/demux thread pulls the live stream
 * (RTSP-over-TCP / RTMP / MPEG-TS / fragmented-MP4), splits it into elementary
 * H.264/H.265 + AAC, and feeds the OS decoders. Decoded video lands in a
 * platform texture; decoded audio lands in a lock-free PCM ring that the C# audio
 * sink pulls on the Unity audio thread.
 *
 * Threading contract:
 *   - basis_media_open/close/play/pause/stop and all getters are safe to call
 *     from the Unity main thread.
 *   - basis_media_read_audio and basis_media_get_audio_format are called from
 *     the Unity audio thread. They are safe to call concurrently with
 *     basis_media_close: a pull already under way when close begins completes
 *     against a live engine, because close blocks for its duration. The host
 *     does not have to quiesce the audio thread first.
 *
 *     A pull that starts after close has begun is validated against an internal
 *     registry before the engine is dereferenced, and returns instead of
 *     touching freed memory — read_audio returns 0 and get_audio_format returns
 *     -1. Those are the same values an empty ring and an unknown format give,
 *     and that is deliberate: a caller has no use for the distinction, since
 *     both mean "no audio this callback" and the correct response to either is
 *     silence.
 *
 *     That second property is a safety net, not a licence to keep the handle.
 *     The registry matches on the pointer, so once the engine is freed a later
 *     basis_media_open can hand back the same address, and a call still using
 *     the stale handle would be accepted as belonging to the new engine. Drop
 *     the handle when close returns, as any C API requires; the net is there to
 *     make the audio thread's own in-flight window safe, not to support calls
 *     issued after the host has moved on.
 *   - The function returned by basis_media_get_render_event_func runs on the
 *     Unity render thread only (issued via CommandBuffer.IssuePluginEventAndData).
 *   - basis_media_get_texture returns a handle that is only valid to bind after
 *     at least one BASIS_RENDER_UPDATE has run and get_frame_counter() > 0.
 *
 * License: MIT (this wrapper). No third-party code is statically linked; all
 * decoding uses OS frameworks, so there are no extra license obligations.
