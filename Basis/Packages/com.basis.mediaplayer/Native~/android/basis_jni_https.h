/*
 * basis_jni_https.h — Android HTTPS byte source backed by java.net.HttpsURLConnection.
 *
 * The portable demuxers read every https container through this source. NDK has
 * no TLS API of its own; the smallest dependency-free option is to bridge to
 * Java via JNI.
 *
 * Same contract as protocol/basis_http: open returns an opaque ctx, read fills a
 * caller buffer (bytes read; 0 = EOF; <0 = error), close frees it. Read is called
 * on the demux thread; the JNI layer attaches that thread to the JVM as needed.
