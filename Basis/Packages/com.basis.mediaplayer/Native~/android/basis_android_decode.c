/*
 * basis_android_decode.c — Android/Quest MediaCodec backend (implements basis_decoder_*).
 *
 * The core demuxes every container (portable basis_mp4/ts/webm/... over
 * basis_jni_https) and feeds coded access units through submit_video/
 * submit_audio; this backend creates the MediaCodec from the codec + extradata
 * and queues the AUs.
 *
 * Video output goes to an AImageReader Surface in HardwareBuffer mode; each
 * decoded AHardwareBuffer is handed to the Vulkan present (basis_android_vk),
 * which imports it and resolves YCbCr -> an RGBA VkImage Unity samples.
 * Audio (AAC) is decoded to PCM and written to a ring the C# sink pulls.
