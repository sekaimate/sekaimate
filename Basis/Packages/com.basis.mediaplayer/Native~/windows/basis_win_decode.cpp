/*
 * basis_win_decode.cpp — Windows OS-codec backend (implements basis_decoder_*).
 *
 * Pipeline:
 *   submit_video (demux thread): feed video AUs (Annex-B H.264/H.265, raw
 *     VP9/AV1 samples) to the Media Foundation decoder MFT running on a DXVA-enabled
 *     D3D11 device. Decoded NV12 is
 *     converted to BGRA by an ID3D11VideoProcessor into a keyed-mutex *shared*
 *     texture on the decode device.
 *   render_update (render thread): copy the shared BGRA into the Unity-visible
 *     output texture (created on Unity's device) under the keyed mutex.
 *   submit_audio: feed raw AAC to the AAC decoder MFT -> float PCM -> ring.
 *
 * Graphics targets:
 *   D3D11 — output texture created on Unity's ID3D11Device (BGRA). Primary path.
 *   D3D12 — present copies the due ring slot into a TYPELESS shared texture on the
 *           decode device; Unity opens that on its ID3D12Device and wraps it with
 *           CreateExternalTexture. Typeless is required so Unity can cast the sRGB
 *           SRV its (linear) colour space needs — a typed UNORM resource rejects
 *           sRGB SRV creation under D3D12. The render thread polls an event query until
 *           the copy retires on the GPU and only publishes once completion is confirmed
 *           and Unity holds the external texture, so Unity never samples a half-written
 *           or absent copy. A keyed mutex orders the decode-write against Unity's read.
 *
 * Notes / iterate-here:
 *   - Uses a synchronous (DXVA) decoder MFT via MFTEnumEx. Async hardware MFTs
 *     (event-driven) would lower latency further but need METransform* handling.
 *   - HEVC requires an installed HEVC decoder MFT (HEVC Video Extensions);
 *     VP9 and AV1 likewise (Store "VP9 Video Extensions" / "AV1 Video
 *     Extension", or a vendor MFT).
