The logic loop runs hundreds of times a second, so flushing every pass emits many half-empty datagrams and the server pays full per-packet cost for each; holding a partial buffer briefly lets consecutive passes coalesce. A buffer that fills the MTU is always sent immediately, so this caps added latency rather than adding it — only small sends ever wait, and never longer than this value. 2-5 is a reasonable range; raise it to cut packet rate further, lower it if voice latency matters more than CPU.

Oldest are dropped first because a newer position update supersedes them. WARNING: this used to be a fixed 256, which is too small to be only a backstop - at 2000 players it discarded roughly half of every avatar update produced, and because discarding is cheaper than sending, the reduction system read the resulting fast ticks as spare capacity and produced even more.

Halve it to double the workers. Tune it against the pass time in the [CPU] log line: above 25 ms with cores to spare means this is too high.

Setting a number here pins the pool and opts out of that, and is clamped to the core count. The pass runs hundreds of times a second and does little work per peer, so letting it spread across every core costs more in thread wake-up and GC-poll traffic than it saves.

Sends: the send loop gets SLOWER with more threads on one socket - measured at 1000 players, 8 to 16 to 32 send workers took the update phase from 6.1 to 12.9 to 15.4 ms per tick while throughput fell from 497 to 393 MB/s - so another socket, not another core, is what adds capacity. Receives: one receive thread is one core's worth of syscall throughput, and past that the kernel discards inbound datagrams; this never appears as high CPU because the thread is pinned either way, so it is detected from the kernel's RcvbufErrors counter. On machines with many weak cores the useful range runs to 64 sockets, which is where the auto derivation lands on a 128-core host. Growth needs sustained pressure, except on receive drops which act immediately - and a socket added for drops is then checked: if the drop rate does not fall, growth stops, because the cause is not something more receive threads can fix (raise sysctl net.core.rmem_max, or the link is full).
